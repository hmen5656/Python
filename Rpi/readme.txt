I am still developing this project
basiclly its a Smart parking area system for handicaped peope.
in any parking area we are specifying some places for handicaped people and those areas only accesible with plate recognition or RFID card scanning system, when a normal car reaches to park in hadicaped places bariers will not let tem to park , other wise when a handicaped person come to park his/her car plate recognition system will identify plate or with RFID car the bariers will open and let them to park places. people who doesnt have any handicaped they wont be able to park their place ever.
